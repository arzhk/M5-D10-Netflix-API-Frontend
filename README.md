Netflix, Register

      Use your React skills to improve your existing projects.


    Netflix App


        Create a new Registration Component and create a new route /register and a button in the navbar to get there


        In the Registration Component, create a Controlled Form with:

          Name - Required, at least 2 chars
          Surname - Required, at least 3 chars
          Email - Required - Should be an email field
          Password - Required - Should contain at least 8 chars, 1 digit, 1 letter
          Year of Birth - Required - from 1910+
          Street Address - Required
          City - Required
          Postal Code - Required - Numeric 5 digits
          Credit card - XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX (EXTRA)



        All the messages / errors should be displayed properly on the page


        The submit button from the form should be "ENABLED" only when the form is actually OK. When clicked it should
        display a recap of the information submitted (you choose if this recap should be just a component dinamically
        rendered in the current route or a component mounted on a different route with a redirect).


        [EXTRA] Transform the "AddComment" component into a Controlled Form
